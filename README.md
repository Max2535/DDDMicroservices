# DDD Microservices Project

This project is a demonstration of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles applied to a microservices architecture.

## Features

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Structuring the project around the core business domain.
- **Microservices**: Decomposing the application into smaller, independently deployable services.
